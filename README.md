# QYMWTA or Questions you may want to ask

# Q: Does this code work?
# A: Maybe
Most the code I do on here isn’t checked that well
(in the case of Unity that is)

# Q: Is rOSrewrite good?
# A: No
It's still very buggy and not even close to what I want it to be

# Q: Should I use this code?
# A: Maybe
Unity: Yes, RoverOS: No, Linux: No (unless its gs2d then Yes)

# Yes I know the kernel build script isn’t finished 
I will finish that at some point... maybe
