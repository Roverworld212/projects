# QYMWTA or Questions you may want to ask

# Q: Does this code work?
# A: Maybe
Most the code I do on here isn’t checked that well
(in the case of Unity that is)

# Q: Will RoverOS be updated?
# A: Probably not
I opened the assembly file and tried to fix it once.
Im not working on that monster of stolen code ever again.

# Q: Should I use this code?
# A: Maybe
Unity: Yes, RoverOS: No, Linux: No (unless its gs2d then Yes)

# Yes I know the kernel build script isn’t finished 
I will finish that at some point... maybe
