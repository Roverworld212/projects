# QYMWTA or Questions you may want to ask

# Q: Does this code work?
# A: Maybe
Most the code I do on here isnâ€™t checked that well
(in the case of Unity that is (and rOSrewrite))

# Q: Is rOSrewrite good?
# A: No
It's still very buggy and not even close to what I want it to be

# Q: Should I use this code?
# A: Maybe
Unity: Yes
#
rOSrewrite: Yes (Some code doesn't work properly and I will remove them later and/or update them)
#
Linux: No (unless its gs2d then Yes(which has nothing in it so go ahead))
